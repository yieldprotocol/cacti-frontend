# Welcome to Cacti üåµ Components üèúÔ∏è

<p>
  CactiComponents is a modular set of User Interface (UI) components designed to
  facilitate seamless integration of new platforms and protocols into
  Cacti-Chat, an AI chatbot specifically designed to simplify decentralized
  finance (DeFi) actions and allow for easy sharing across various protocols.
  These components are aimed at creating a standardized, efficient, and
  high-quality UI, thereby streamlining the development process and ensuring an
  excellent user experience.
</p>
<p>
  Each component is a self-contained, reusable piece of code that standardizes
  certain elements of the UI. Using these components, developers can construct
  complex UIs by combining smaller, manageable pieces. This modularity not only
  promotes reusability and consistency but also improves maintainability and
  scalability of the application.
